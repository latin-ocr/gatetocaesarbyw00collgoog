OW that the Baginner’s Latin Book has been before the public
, nearly five years, the publishers are able to say without hesita-
tion that it has been far more successful than any other introduc-
tory Latin book ever published in this country. This remarkable
resultis due to a combination οι excellences so shiliully blended
Ι that effecte are more patent than causes. While the book maybe
used as an introduction to Caesar, it is more than this,- it is an
introduction to Latin as a language. It prepares the student not
only to begin the study οι Gaesar, bnt, vrith proper guidance, to
make remarkably rapid aad satisfactory propresr in reading and¹
understanding Latin. The skill οι the authors as teachers has
enabled them to secure these larger results without deviation from
the main line or increase οι difficulties. The fundamental idea was,
ιο combine the utmost practice with the minimum οι theory, on
the principle that a thorough acquisition oi the elementa of Latin
by the young learner must be more a process than a soience, more
the work of observation, comparison, and imitation thau the me·
chanical followingoi rules or the exercise οι analysis and consciens
inductive reasoning. There are therefore abundant and varied.
exercises on the forms and more important constructione of the
language. The skilful choice of words has made it possible to
provide exercises that are in themselves interesting. The colloquia
(simple Latin dialogues), the extracta ior translation, introduced
ts early as possible, and the mode of treatment throughout are
made ιο impart attractiveness lreshness and variety, though there
„is no sacrifice of rigorous scientifio method. Eveu if the time
allowed ior Latin the first year is quite limited, teochers may still
be able to carry classes through the book by omitting certain de-
tachable portione oi the course. Provision has been made for the
praa tical use of latin m o'ral teacbing.
