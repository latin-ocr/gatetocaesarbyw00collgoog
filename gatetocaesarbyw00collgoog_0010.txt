iv 11101000.

Oaesar is a difficult author. Some parts of his Gallie War
are as hard, or nearly as hard, as any prose Latin that 1100
00010 down 10110. Yet it has somehow strangely enough
become the fashion to read that work first in 0 Latin course.
My own conviction is that 101 young learnera 0 years read-
ing in easier Latin is not too much before taking up the
less difficolt books 01 the Gallio War. Even then the
110001110010 Caesar comes with something 01 0 shock; 101
,1110 1001001 10 0000 and often brought 100010 face with
sentences that seem to him 01 10001 bewildering intricacy,
however they may, 00 commentators sometimes remark,
beautifully illustrate most important principles 01 Latin
order and construction. There isa sentence 10 the second
book, by 00 100000 the most difficult one to be found, that
extends through eighteen lines—that 10, something 01010
than half 0 page-containing twentyone distinct ideas,

and having the verb separated from its subJ'ect by nincty· ο

1001 words.

I know nemore dishearteniug task than that 01 under·
taking to carry a class unprepared in age and knowledge
of the languagc through Caesar’s Gallie War. Yet it is pre-
ciscly this dishearteniug task that thousands 01 teachers 010
001 10 do, or set themselves 10 (10, every year. The results

= 010 01100 dismal enough. Teachers are blamed, they blame

themselves, they blame their pupils, Pupils may sometimes

be stupid, teachers may lack knowledge 01 the languagc
and the subject, but the fault may 0100110 wholly with the
author or with the Latin language 110011 3 if with the latter,
there is no help. Latin, it must be confessed, is 00 exceed-
ingly difficult language to 10010. All the more reason then
why, 10 attacking it, every unnecessary obstacle should be
removed We should make our approaches with cantion
