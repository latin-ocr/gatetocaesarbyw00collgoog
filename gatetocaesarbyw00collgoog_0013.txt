to supply a form plainly understood, or to introduce some
connective, like et, tum, itaque, cutem.

2 As to the amount of excision, Ι lind that Ι have omitted
almost exactly one-fifth oi Caesar's text.

Ii the beginner in Oaesar reads the simplified text and
concurrently turns the Exercises into Latin, laying firm
hold of the grammatical principles selected for illustration,
I believe he will find the remaining difficulties of the origi·
nal text not beyond his scope. Ι should even'hope that
he would then read with something cf the joy oi consciens
power. If the reading of the texts and thc'writing oi the
Exercises should require more time than is usually spent

on the second book oi Caesar, which, however, I doubt, I
⁸ believe subsequent progress would still be rapid and satis·
factory enough to amount to a net gain and saving of time.

It has seemed best to mark long vowels, except the
vowels of final syllables and of monosyllables, the rules for
which can be readily learned Ι have, however, marked a
few monosyllables, as a constant reminder to teochers who
find their old pronunciatien clinging to certain words. We
used to say hia, sic, adn, quin, hcc. These words, therefore,
Ι have marked. On the other hand, one is in no danger oi
saying de, hi, si, pro, for old habit would not mislead.

Ι take pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to Mr.
Alfred G. Rolfe for several useful criticisms, and to Miss
Caroline Ober Stone for oarefully reading the proofsheets
as faras the vocabularies. Το Mr. Clarence W. Gleason Ι
am specially indebted. But for his timely and generous aid,
both in the correction of the proci and in the preparation
oi the vocabularies, the publicationes this book must have

been very considerably delayed
