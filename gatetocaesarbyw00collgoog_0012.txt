inevitably floor them, that has prompted me 10 001 my - ⁴

hand to this wo‘rlr, which, slight as it may seem, has eost me
the leisure 01 many months. But I shall feel repaid 100-
fold, 11, through this little book, boys aud girls are enabled
10 read Caesar with less waste 01 time, more easily, with
fresher interest, and added sense 01 power; 11,10 other
words, it proves in reality what it is in name, 0 Gate 10
cesar. η

Α few words will be sufficient 10 explain the principle ou
which I have simplified Caesar's text, the amount 01 01010100,
and the degree 01 change. It would have been a compara
tively easy task to simplify the text hythe mere process
01 omission, never deviating from the ipsissimo cerba 01 the
author by so 100011 as the change 01 0 mode 01 tense. One
could do this and still string together the disjecto 0100111νο
0111101011 1010 something like a connected narrative. But
that would be to preserve the integrity 01 the words 01 the
expense 01 everything else, -inner 10101100, structure, style,
spirit. Orthe simplification might be effected by a virtual
rewriting 01 the 1011, by amplification rather than 01100100-
sion, ooupled with changes in the collocation 01 words,
where the arrangement seemed to obscure the meaning and
perplex the learner.

My purpose and plan differed essentially from both these
methods My aim has been, first, 10 keep the narrative in-

’ tact; second, 10 101010 00 much 01 1110 text as was consistent ἵ
with the 011011 10 disburden it 01110 greater difficulties3 ,

third, 10 make the fewest practicable changes in what was
retained, these, I believe, being almost entirely limited to
modification 01 verb forms with the necessary concomitant
alterations3 fourth, very rarely to change the position 01 0
word3 finally, 0000010 insert 0 word, 000001 000001000110
