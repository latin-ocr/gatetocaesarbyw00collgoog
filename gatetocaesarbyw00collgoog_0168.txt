THE editor believes that the poems of Ovid are, as regards both

style and subjectmatter, admirably adapted to serve as an
introduction to the study of Latin Poetry. He has therefore fur·
nished the book with copious notes suited to the needs of young
students‚ supplemented with grammatical references and an intro
duction ou the life and works of Ovid‚ and on mythology.

The selections were chosen with a view to making the study of
Latin interesting. Most of them are from the Metamorphoses, of
which about onethird has been taken. By help of the argument,
which is given in full, the editor has endeavored not merely to
show the connection of the tales and the ingenuity of the transi-
tione-necessary to comprehensi the poem as a whole-but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology, at least of those narratives which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more
or less into every modern literature. ,

The first eighty-eight lines of Book 1. have been omitted because
of their difficulty and lack oi interest From the Fasti three seleo-
tions are given3 from the Heroides, one3 from the Amores, thrse3
from the Tristia, five; and of the letters from Pontus, one. Special
care has been taken to preserve the more interesting biographical
hints oi the lesser poems.

Professor Greeuough’s vocabulary, similar iu style and character 3
to his Caesar, Cicero, and Virgil vocabularies‚ will doubtless be ready r
before the autumn of 1891. In the meantime Allen’s Lexicon ,

will fill its place.
