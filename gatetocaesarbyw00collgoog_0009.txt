2 Tau reeent diseovery of a work of Aristotle has inter·
ested and delighted the whole learned world; but one may
venture to say that if, instead, a book had been found
written ln the hest period of the Latin language for the
amusement or instruction of youth, by some Roman De
Foe, or Goldsmith, or Lamb, or Burnett‚ there would beten
times the reason for rejoieing. Uuhappily there is uo
likelihood that we shall ever congratulete ourselves on

. euoh a “liud'' for probably no such work ever existed.

’ What a misfortuue that it did uot oeeur to Cieero to divort
himself iu some leisure hour hy writiug a story for Roman
youth! Millions of boys and girls in these later ages would
have had good reason to bless his name. Caesar oould have
done it3 but to him, too, the gods denied sueh an inspiration,
and we must suffer for it. Seeing that he had oomposed a .
¹ treatise on Latin Grammar, one almost wonders that a mind
so original and fertile should not have ooneeived the idea
of adapting his Gallie War, or sonre part of it, to the
powers aud eomprelreusion of youth. What measureless
gratitudo would he not have wou from unhorn generations
of sohoolmasters, who have now to struggle desperately and
often unavailingly to make oleat to their pupils the meaning
of his intricate periodo, and untwist the strande of his
hnotty syntaxi
