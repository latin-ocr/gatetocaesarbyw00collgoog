Caesar knew how to write his own language well; but he
wrote for men, he wrote with compression and in haste, and
there are passages in his works that are tough reading for a
good Latin soholar. It is the fashion to praise Oaesars lu-

For my part Ι confess that Ι sometimes find him obscure.
Moteover, when Ι am iu doubt as to his meaning and appeal
to the commentators, Ι find that they generally disagree and
sometimes quarrel about the sense. Therefore to put young
learners to reading Caesar as his text stands, bristling with
difficulties, before they have aoquired anything more than a
meagre voeabulary and gained a modinum ot insight by some
praetioe in reading easier Latin, is to set them at a task
harder than that whioh Pharaoh set the Israelites.

Iam of the opinion that, even when a fair working voeabu-
lary has been aequired through some previous reading, there
ie no book of the Gallio War that does not require a certain
degree of simplification to bring it to the level of the powers
of young boys and girls. Itis this oonviotion born of long
observation of the vexation of spirit, disoouragement, and
waste of time by pupils iu wrestling with difficulties that
