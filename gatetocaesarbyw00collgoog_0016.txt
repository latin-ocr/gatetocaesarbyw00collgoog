NOTE ΟΝ THE Usu 01⁴¹ ΤΗΕ ΒΟΟΚ.

Τιο Simplified Text and the Exercises based upon it are ol the
first importance. The vica voce translation of the Exercises, followed
by the writing oi them, will· illustrate and help ιο implant in the
memory the most important principles of syntax met with in the text.
Let the teacher insist upon thorough work here, and he may safely·
omit other syntectical instruction.

But little power oi reading Latin can be gained without making
the acquisition oi a working vocabulary a distinct object The Latin
synonyme and the Etymological Vocabulary may be made useml
agents tc tbat end. li the words added ιο each chapter are read
aloud, reviewed, and compared where baclrward references are made,
the ieamer will acquire a useful stock ot synonyme easily, naturally,
and with small expenditure oi time. ’

It is often easicr ιο retain in mind a number ol words, grouped
according to some principle of similarity or contrast, than a single
word with nothing ιο book it ιο ιιο memory. For this reason it ie
recommended that the Etymological Vocabulary ιο often pressed into-
tbe service. suppose, for example, the word conspectur occurs in the
loeson Ii the toacher will turn to page 138 and have the ten words
read out under the root SPEC, he will multiply several times ιιο
chanccs that this particular word will be remembered on its next
occurrence. Hc will bave done much more. He will have increaeed
the chauces that nine other words will be lodged in the memory, and
to each one a fresh interest will be added by its being seen in relation,
not ae an isolated‚ and therefore barren, lact.

Τιο first vocabulary may be used for comparing in the text the

. different meanings aud uses of ιιο same word. lt ie through euch

comparisone that one gete at the beart and spirit oi the language,
while cultivating at the same time a mental habit ol great value.

-Having read ιιο Simplified Text, the ieamer should be well equipped . Ἰ

lor wrestling with the difficulties that remain in the unchangcd text,
for hc is already familiar with the thought and ιιο language. Com·

parison of the two texts by the teacher, sc lar as time permits, may
now be made ιο illustrate important principlee, as oi indirect discouree,
which are here and there discussed in the notes.
